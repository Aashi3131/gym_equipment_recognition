Hey, if you're here to build an image recognition model that takes in a gym equipment picture and classifies that equipment- you're at the right place.
We will be building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify gym equipment images.

Phase 1:
Download the zip file named "gym_equipment_recognition_model_compressed_dataset".
Decompress it by extracting all files.
Upload it on your drive.
Open google colab and start writing in a new colab notebook (use the code named "gym_equipment_recognition_model").
Run it and you'll get a model named "model.h5"!

Phase 2:
We will use the trained model named "model.h5" obtained from the above steps.
Open VS Code.
Upload the folder named "streamlit".
It contains the home page image, labels, and the code to an api using streamlit.
Run the main.py file using the command "streamlit run main.py".
This will open the main api and host it locally.

Phase 3:
Click on "Prediction".
Upload image of the equipment you want to classify.
Click on predict and the model will predict the label.
